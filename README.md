# C - Simple Shell


## Description

The project involved writing a simple shell in C using a limited number of standard library functions.
The goal of this project was to help us understand how the shell works.
A shell, in the context of computing, is a command-line interpreter that provides users with a textual interface to interact with the operating system. It allows users to execute commands, run scripts, and manage system resources through a command-line interface.

### *Typically, a shell provides the following functionalities:*<br>
1.Command Execution: Runs commands entered by users, ranging from basic file operations to running programs.<br>
2.Command Parsing: Analyzes commands to identify the command name and its arguments, handling special characters like redirections and pipes.<br>
3.I/O Redirection: Allows users to redirect input and output streams, like saving command output to a file.<br>
4.Pipeline Support: Lets users chain multiple commands together, with the output of one command becoming the input of the next.<br>
5.Background Execution: Runs commands in the background, freeing up the terminal for other tasks.<br>
6.Scripting: Enables users to automate tasks by writing scripts containing sequences of commands.<br>
7.Environment Management: Manages the environment, including system configuration settings and program paths.<br>


## Usage

### *Interactive Mode*
$ ./shell <br>
$ /bin/ls <br>
$ exit <br>

### *Non-interactive Mode*
$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./shell <br>
$ cat test_file <br>
$ cat test_file | ./shell <br>


### *All function descriptions*

Function | Description
 ------------ | ------------- 
execute_command | Executes the path or commands 
*get_input | My own getline function
handle_env | Handle the first argv element was a env
handle_path | Designed to handle finding and executing commands within the shell environment
*line_devider | Parse a user-provided input string (buffer) into an array of arguments.
path_handler | My own handle_path function


## Installation/Compilation

`1. Clone the repository:` <br>
git clone [https://github.com/Pakizamutallim/holbertonschool-simple_shell.git](https://github.com/Pakizamutallim/holbertonschool-simple_shell.git) <br>
`2. Compile the source code:` <br>
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh <br>
`3. Run the shell:` <br>
./hsh
 

## Requirements

To compile and run the shell, you need:
> *C Compiler:* The source code is written in C, so you'll need a C compiler like GCC to compile it.

> *Operating System:* The shell is designed for Unix-like operating systems. It may work on other systems with minor modifications, but it's primarily intended for Unix-based environments. <br>

**That's all you need to get started with compiling and running the shell!**

## Examples

#### The following examples demonstrate various usage scenarios for the simple shell. They showcase different commands and interactions with the shell environment.

**Example 1: Listing files using ls**

 ![bash screenshot](./bash.png)
This image shows the output of the `ls` command, which lists the files and directories in the current working directory.


**Example 3: Displaying file contents using `cat`**

 ![bash screenshot](./lsl.png)
This image shows the output of the `cat` command, which displays the contents of the file named "test_file.txt".
 

**Example 2: Creating a directory using `mkdir`**
 
 ![bash screenshot](./mkdir.png)
This image demonstrates the use of the `mkdir` command to create a new directory named "new_directory" in the current working directory.
